# perfect-python-4-windows
=Setting up Windows 10 development environment for python development (Chocolatey, MiniConda, PyCharm, Windows Terminal, cloud storage)=

This is short (and hopefully sweet :-) ) set of instructions for creating fast, efficient and highly operational enviroment for python development.

Given nature of today's development, it is expected that you develop same project from multiple location: from Work office, from home, from travel laptop ... Synhronising all of that can be very cumbersome and complicated.

That is basic reason for creating this set of instructions and scripts - to enable today's nomad developers to do real creative work w/o worrying too much about on which machine you are and which state you left project on previous work place.

Some assumptions:
- all files will be on some cloud storage and ideally, letter assigned will be same on all machines
